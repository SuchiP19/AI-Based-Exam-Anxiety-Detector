# AI-Based Exam Anxiety Detector

## Overview

The AI-Based Exam Anxiety Detector is an intelligent mental-wellness support system designed to identify and categorize exam-related anxiety from student-generated text inputs. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a BERT-based deep learning model to analyse linguistic patterns associated with stress, fear, nervousness, and emotional pressure.

## Features

- **Real-time Anxiety Classification**: Categorizes anxiety into Low, Moderate, and High levels.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Handles text input and provides model inference.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Intuitive user interface with visual indicators and anxiety-management tips.
- **Supportive Tool**: Designed as a non-diagnostic tool to assist students and educators.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI, Hugging Face Transformers (BERT).
- **Frontend**: Streamlit.
- **Model**: Fine-tuned BERT for classification.
